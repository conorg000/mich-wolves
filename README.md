Data visualisation of Michigan Wolverines' performance against other college football teams

This was the final assignment for Coursera's Applied Plotting and Visualization course. It was quite open-ended, but the project had to use datasets related to 'Michigan sport' to answer some sort of question. I chose to visualise Michigan Wolverines' historic competitiveness against other teams in the Big Ten College Football league. This involved web scraping through historic data to get tallies of their net wins against other teams. I then used seaborn to visualise the results in a heatmap.
